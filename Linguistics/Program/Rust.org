rustup doc
#+END_SRC
to open a local documentation which contains many useful materials on learning Rust.

- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html][The official Rust book]]
  + This book is really a good place to start!
- Programming Rust by Jim Blandy
  + Now I assume this book should definitely be your second book after the official rust book.
    This book also has more diagrams of various situations and many useful examples.
- Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists
  + This should not be your first book into Rust, but it is quite helpful to understand Rust deeper!
- The Rustonomicon
  + This book covers some basic knowledge on the dark side of Rust (i.e. unsafe Rust) and
    also some clearer explanation on various Rust designs.
