* Learning map A
- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html][The official Rust book]]
  + This book is really a good place to start!
- Programming Rust by Jim Blandy
  + Now I assume this book should definitely be your second book after the official rust book.
    This book also has more diagrams of various situations and many useful examples.
- Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists
  + This should not be your first book into Rust, but it is quite helpful to understand Rust deeper!


* Resources

- A Rust book list from [[https://github.com/sger/RustBooks/blob/master/README.md][Github@sger/RustBooks]] (Just in case, a backup is [[file:./Rust-books.md][here]]).
- Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists
