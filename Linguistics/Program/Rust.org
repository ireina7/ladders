* Learning map A
- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html][The official Rust book]]
  This book is really a good place to start!
- Programming Rust by Jim Blandy
  Now I assume this book should definitely be your second book after the official rust book.
  This book has more diagrams of various situations and many useful examples.

* Resources

- A Rust book list from [[https://github.com/sger/RustBooks/blob/master/README.md][Github@sger/RustBooks]] (Just in case, a backup is [[file:./Rust-books.md][here]]).
